        "description": "AB Dynamics is an automotive testing company, with a vast range of products from steering robots to driving simulators. I joined as a software engineer, where I immediately identified the vast potential for using vestibular stimulation on the static driving simulator that could emulate dynamic motion. After the approval for a feasibility study, I integrated the simulator's environment with BrainPatch's stimulators with the driving simulators to create the sensation of roll and yaw. I am currently developing this system and hope to conduct a formal experiment shortly."

        "description": "BrainPatch is a cutting edge neurotech start-up who aim to create an appstore for the brain. Working alongside the CTO, I assembled and tested a prototype circuit that will be used in their upcoming headsets to stimulate the vestibular system. I then went on to design an analogue backend sensor for EEG/ECG recording. This involved writing to an ADC over SPI, programming the microcontroller in C++, using Python to control the sensor over a remote TCP connection, and designing the electronics and PCB. The first prototype EEG/ECG sensor is soon to be tested and I will continue to work on its development."
