I wrote firmware in C++ for remote data recording and streaming to a server and developed a web app in Python. I also implemented cloud computing and inference using AWS and SQL to process data and transmit it to a web interface in real time. The device was used in trials to monitor real-time participant biosensing information remotely and is will contribute to a commercial machine learning consumer product to detect stress, which was a focus of my Bachelor's Dissertation and now Master's thesis."

I joined as a software engineer and was the embedded lead for a new MISRA compliant product. This involved processing real-time automotive data using CAN and writing drivers, in C++, for the various peripherals of the STM32 microcontroller. Additionally, to this project, I identified the vast potential for using vestibular stimulation on the static driving simulator that could emulate dynamic motion. After the approval for a feasibility study, I integrated the simulator's environment with BrainPatch's stimulators with the driving simulators to create the sensation of rotational forces. I worked closely with the embedded team, writing C++ for both the stimulator’s firmware and the server software. I am continuing to research vestibular stimulation for emulating motion."

        "description": "After being frustrated with my friends' (and my own) obsession with smartphones, I created a start-up, PhoneCave, that aims to get people off their phones. I wanted to design a gadget that can be used for social situations, to have conversations without distractions, to improve productivity and mindfulness. PhoneCave is a simple idea - a lock box for your phone, keeping it out of reach for as long as you set it. I learnt enormously from starting this business – greatly improving my programming (firmware written in C++), CAD skills, electronics and PCB design. I also learnt new skills like 3d printing manufacturing, web design and marketing. PhoneCave has also increased my entrepreneurial grit. There were an enormous number of problems to overcome, crucially finding suppliers to cut costs and streamlining manufacturing. I have shipped PhoneCaves to over 10 countries worldwide, held a promotional campaign on kickstarter and seeked investors. This startup is on hold, as it requires significant funding for injection moulding."
